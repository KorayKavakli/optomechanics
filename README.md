# Description
Printable optomechanics that we designed in computational light laboratory.
We tested these in-house designed parts in our experiments, please always pay attention to grab `*.stl` file from each folder with the latest version number (e.g., `lens_cap_v005.stl`).
We print these designed parts using a `Snapmaker Original 3D printer`, and we design parts in FreeCAD.
The original design files are also included at each folder (extension: `*.FCStd`).
In [gallery](./gallery) folder you will find example photographs showing our designed and printed parts in action.
If you encounter any trouble in using our designs, please do not hesitate to reach out using the issues sections in this repository.
