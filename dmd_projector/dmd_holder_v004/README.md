# DMD Holder for Rif6 Cube Projector

This holder is designed to hold the DMD chip of a Rif6 Cube projector so that it sits on the outside of the projector housing. This allows it to be used on its own in optical setups.

The included image shows an example of the fitted mount.

## Required tools and supplies

* Spudger or blade to remove plastic cover from case
* Optionally some way to heat the adhesive
Both the above are included in this [Ifixit Kit](https://store.ifixit.co.uk/products/iopener)

* Small screws for fitting DMD to holder (M1.6 or smaller, e.g. [these from Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07N2L2P3S/))
* Precision screwdriver
* Opaque tape (e.g. black electrical tape) to block light from the projector itself.

If you'd like to screw the holder to the case for a really strong fit, you will also need:

* Precision drill bits (e.g. 1.4 and 1.6mm, depending what screws you use) and I'd recommend a manual drill e.g. [this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Linkstyle-Drill-30Pcs-Precision-Rotary-30PICS/dp/B07PJ71YF2/)

## Hacking the Projector

The first step is to remove the plastic cover from one side of the projector. The side you want is the one with the mini-HDMI port. It may pry off easily, but if not gently heating the adhesive may help.

This should expose the DMD chip, which is attached by a **very delicate** ribbon cable to the projector. Remove the two screws holding it in with great care and it should be possible to pull the DMD chip very slightly out of the projector. Take care not to pull it out too far.

## Printing and Adjusting the Holder

Print the holder on your printer of choice. I find that FDM printers don't have the precision necessary to print the holes to the correct diameter, so I tend to print them a bit small and then use the drill to achieve the precise size required.

For example, if using 1.6mm screws I'd print the holder and then use a 1.4mm drill bit to widen the screw holes. This should allow a 1.6mm screw to bite into the holder and hold the DMD securely.

Ensure that the clip that fits on the edge of the projector case is clean and free from 3D printing "zits".

## Fitting the holder

It is possible to just screw the DMD to the holder and clip the edge to the aluminium DMD case. Again, take care not to stress the delicate ribbon cable. Test the DMD after fitting to ensure there are no blank lines in the output image - these can occur if the cable is too stressed.

## Optional - screwing the holder to the case

You can optionally also screw the holder to the aluminium case for a more secure fit. To do so, once the holder is in the desired position, mark the location for the holes. Unclip the holder and drill a hole the same diameter as the screws (e.g. 1.6mm if using M1.6 screws). Take care that no aluminium makes its way inside the DMD and causes a short! 

Once this is complete you can clip the holder back onto the case and fit the screws.
